ObjectID in mongodb,

Returns a new ObjectId. The 12-byte ObjectId consists of:

1. A 4-byte timestamp, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

2. A 5-byte random value generated once per process. This random value is unique to the machine and process.

3. A 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value.

ObjectId() has the following methods:

ObjectId.getTimestamp() - Returns the timestamp portion of the object as a Date.
ObjectId.toString() - Returns the ObjectId as a hexadecimal string.
ObjectId.valueOf() - Returns ObjectId.self.
